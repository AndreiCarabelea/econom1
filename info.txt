My assignment questions, or other things related to assignment:  

 - Fama - French Factors - daily variances in csv 
 - Need to get log returns from prices and express in daily  percentage returns 
 - For fixed entity effects and fixed time effects, the mean of the errors don't need to be substracted  before performing demeaned regression 
 - After performing demeaned regression, the OLS package reports wrong standard errors , number of degrees of freedom must include also the removed number of dummies : N - k - D , N total number of observations , k number of regressors 
D number of dummies . Need to correct that to interpret the results ? 

           
         From Charlie implementation of the homework: 
         We should get something similar if correct: 
                                                         t statistic 
         MKTRF : 0.9843 ( market - risk free rate )      53
         SMB   : 0.11                                    53   
         HML:    0.21                                    139  
- We must remove the first company from each sector to make sure we don't have one company for one sector !! 
- Also n entities should have n-1 dummies 
- If the number of dummies are higher than number of companies we must combine the index of the dataframe to reduce number  of columns ??? An example if there are 6 students and 8 dummies we should have only 6 dummies ( the dummies act like an id for each student) 
 -  We should compare different approaches using F tests ( how ?? ) 
 -  We cannot compare random effects errors to fixed entity errors because they represent different things. 
         Not sure about double entity + time effects vs random effects ?? 
 
 - Indication use linear models package ?
