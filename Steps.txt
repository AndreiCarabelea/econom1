My assignment questions, or other things related to assignment:  

 - Fama- French Factors - daily variances in csv 
 - Need to get log returns from prices and express in daily  percentage returns 
 - For fixed entity effects and fixed time effects, the mean of the errors don't need to be substracted  before performing demeaned regression 
 - After performing demeaned regression, the OLS package reports wrong standard errors , number of degrees of freedom must include also the removed number of dummies : N - k - D , N total number of observations , k number of regressors 
D number of dummies . Need to correct that to interpret the results ? 

           
         From Charlie implementation of the homework: 
         We should get something similar if correct: 
                                                         t statistic 
         MKTRF : 0.9843 ( market - risk free rate )      53
         SMB   : 0.11                                    53   
         HML:    0.21                                    139
